## A little about my coding journey to becoming a developer:


My name is Matthew and I currently live near Raleigh, NC, USA, though I am originally from Tampa, FL. I've always enjoyed taking things apart to see the inner workings of various psychical things. I was first introduced to code by two relatives who are both software engineers.

They encouraged me to learn the basics of web programming: HTML, CSS, and JS. I immediately fell in love with coding. I realized how easy it was to create and dismantle, in a way, my own, digital program. It was so much easier and enjoyable than building and dismantling psychical objects, and didn't cost a cent. 

My goal is to graduate next year (2021) with a job as a software engineer! I've worked very hard towards this goal for the past three years, since my relatives introduced me to the vast world of computer programming. If you're just starting out, don't be intimidated. You may be confused but the best way to alleviate the stress is to make connections with other developers, wether online or in person. Developers are one big family all learning similar concepts even though we may learn various different coding languages.
